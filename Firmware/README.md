# Gantry CNC Motion Control

This repository contains firmware and test programs for a **3-axis gantry-style screwing machine**, supporting multiple stepper motor drivers (DRV8825 and TMC2208).  
The codebase is organized into modules for motion control, homing, positioning, and testing.

- **final/**  
  Final stable build for **3-axis gantry motion control**.

- **go_to_pos/**  
  Precise linear positioning of one axis.

- **homing/**  
  Executes homing in one axis.

- **limit/**  
  Test programs for Limit switch functionality.

- **step_func/**  
  Test programs for verifying Acceleration and Deceleration. 

- **stepper_test/**  
  Test programs for verifying stepper motor functionality.

- **total_positioning/**  
  Precise 2D positioning across the plane.

- **totalhoming/**  
  Executes Homing in all axes of the gantry simultaneously
